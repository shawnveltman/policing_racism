# Racism in Traffic Stops
Tools to analyze racism in police stops across the US

This project merges the police stop data from https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ with the American Community Survey 
to compare police traffic stop rates against the racial makeup of the counties the stops took place in.

A basic analysis and look at the first report generated by this code can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ZRIWWkjf9j0seKmjOkkp9p5DArlAS2sBT2ReGAxgsM/edit?usp=sharing)

A short writeup of initial findings can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u_yFpdUDx_KN0lusjhVebyE6-Je7Laytvnc4aOicqGU/edit?usp=sharing)

Stops are coded by FIPS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards).

To begin, you'll need to download the data from the Stanford Open Policing site, and place the CSVs into into the src/data/stop_data folder.  By default, the report file will be called "master_report.csv" and it will live in the data/summaries directory.  

Example code to run reports on all files in your data/stop_data directory:
```
from src.acsdata import AcsData
from src.reporting import ReportManager

acs = AcsData()
reporting = ReportManager()
reporting.run_reports()
reporting.consolidate_reports()
reporting.update_base_stop_report(acs=acs)
```

Future work should be done to:
1. Break out bias by officer_id (where provied)
2. Get police district shapefiles so we can break down racial makeups by the overlap of those districts, instead of just the county FIPS (the ACS survey gives us info on delightfully granular areas, whereas FIPS is much larger by comparison)
3. Refactor to allow for many different report types to be run - IE breakdown by result of stop, etc
4. Clean out all the vestigal ipynb files
